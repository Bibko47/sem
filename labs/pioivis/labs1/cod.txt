 \sigma_2 (\langle\textit{A,B} \rangle)  = \pi_2 (2^{\emptyset+	\Sigma_{x\in A \cup B} \lbrace x \rbrace })
\]
\[
\pi_2 (B) = \lbrace h(x) \mid x \in B \rbrace
\]
\[
h(\emptyset) = \emptyset
\]
\[
\lbrace h(a) \mid (a \in A) \bigwedge (h(a)=a) \rbrace = A

\[
h(X) = \emptyset \cup \bigcup_{x \in X} \lbrace 2^{ \lbrace h(x) \rbrace } \rbrace  
\]
where \textit{h} defines a mutually unambiguous mapping of
generalized unoriented hereditarily finite sets into generalized ultra-unoriented hereditarily finite sets.

\\{In this case:}
 \[
 A^{(+_2^\ast)} \subseteq A^{(+_1^\ast)}
 \]
      Together with generalized unoriented finite sets, generalized ultra-unoriented finite sets can be mapped mutually
unambiguously to inherited finite sets.

\\ The classical mathematical model works with justified (grounded) sets, but some non-classical models
correspond to other structures. While the structure of
hereditarily finite sets is acyclic and involves various
hierarchies, other (e.g., cholarchical [65] structures consist of elements where each element is a part and is a
whole (composed of parts). Some such structures can
be visualized as periodic or cyclic structures. Another
example of structures that may not fit within the framework of classical mathematical models are non-trivially
automorphic structures, since such models adhere to the
abstraction of identity,. However, despite this, some of
these “non-classical” structures can (under certain conditions) be represented by classical mathematical models.
First of all, among such structures we will be interested
in enumerable structures, i.e., such structures that can be
enumerated.

\\ Let us consider the representation of \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_3)}$} in generalized hereditarily finite sets of the class of countably
non-identically-equal generalized hereditarily finite sets
on the alphabet \textit{\.A}, which can be given according to the
expressions:

\[
\tau_3 (B) \stackrel{def}{=} B
\]
\[ \rho_3 (\langle A,B \rangle) = C  \times (A \cup B)^\ast\]
\[
\sigma_3(\langle A,B \rangle) = D \times \pi_3(2^{\emptyset+	\Sigma_{x\in A \cup B} \lbrace x \rbrace })
\]
\[
\pi_3 (B) = B
\]
\begin{equation*}
a_{2k+1} = 
 \begin{cases}
   &\text{${\dot{a}_k}| k \leq| \dot{A}  \mid$}\\
   &\text{$d(2 \ast k + 1) | k > | \dot{A} \mid$}
 \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\[
a_{2k} = d(2 \ast k)
\]
\[C \cup D = E\]
\[ E = \{ a_{2k} \mid (a_{2k} \in \dot{A}) \bigwedge (k \in \mathbb{N} ) \]
\[ E \subseteq A\]
If
\[ C \cap D = \emptyset\]
then the representations of oriented sets in \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_3)}$}
will not intersect with the representations of unoriented sets
in \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_3)}$} 
\par {Fulfilled:}
\[
 A^{(+_3^\ast)} \subseteq A^{(+_1^\ast)}
 \]
Together with generalized finite sets, representations of
countable non-identically-equal generalized hereditarily
finite sets can be mapped one-to-one onto hereditarily
finite sets.
\par The representation of \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_4)}$} is analogous to \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_2)}$}.
\par The representation of classes of unorient mixed countably non-identically-equal generalized hereditarily finite
sets can be given according to the expressions:
\[ \tau_5 (\textit{A}) = (2^{\emptyset+	\Sigma_{x\in A } \lbrace x\rbrace})\]
\[\rho_5 = \rho_3\]
\[\sigma_5 = \sigma_3\]
\[\pi_5 = \pi_3\]
The representation of classes of orient mixed countably
non-identically-equal generalized hereditarily finite sets
can be given according to the expressions:

\[ \tau_6 (\textit{A}) = \textit{A}^{(\ast ^ 1)}\]
\[\rho_6 = \rho_3\]
\[\sigma_6 = \sigma_3\]
\[\pi_6 = \pi_3\]
\\ Consider the representation of:
    \textit{$A^{(+^ \ast_6)}$} 
    in generalized
hereditarily finite sets of the class of countably nonidentically-equal generalized hereditarily finite sets on
the alphabet \textit{\.A} with codes $\ddot{A}$, which can be given
according to expressions:

\[
\tau_7 (B) \stackrel{def}{=} B
\]
\[ \rho_7 (\langle A,B \rangle) = C  \times (A \cup B)^\ast\]
\[
\sigma_7(\langle A,B \rangle) = D \times \pi_7  (2^{\emptyset+	\Sigma_{x\in A \cup B} \lbrace x \rbrace })
\]
\[
\pi_7 (B) = B
\]
\begin{equation*}
a_{2k+1} = 
 \begin{cases}
   &\text{${\dot{a}_k}| k \leq | \dot{A}  \mid$}\\
   &\text{$d(2 \ast k + 1) | k > | \dot{A} \mid$}
 \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\[
a_{2k} = d(2 \ast k)
\]
\[C \cup D = E\]
\[ E = \{ a_{2k} \mid (a_{2k} \in \dot{A}) \bigwedge (k \in \mathbb{N} ) \]
\[ E \subseteq A\]

where

\[ \ddot{A} \cap \mathbb{N} \neq \emptyset \]
If a number in $\ddot{A}$ is the Ackermann coding of the corresponding set in the representation of enumerably selffounded generalized hereditarily finite sets by hereditarily
finite sets, then such a set is self-founded, i.e. this set is
considered as an element of the alphabet at the same
position in \.A as its code $\ddot{A}$ .
\par To ensure the enumerability of self-founded generalized hereditarily finite sets, it is required to ensure
that they are all finitely mutually-founded, that is, that
they are not infinitely mutually-founded. In this case, the
extensional closure will be reduced to a finite structure
and there will be an algorithm for comparing these
structures provided they are reduced to canonical form.
 \par In general, it is not possible at this stage to canonize the representation of a structure that is a union
of structures of all sets of a given class. To canonize
the representation of such structures requires a separate
investigation of the conditions under which this may be
possible.
The embedding of structures in hereditarily finite sets
and natural numbers (Fig. 1), using Ackermann coding,
gives a structure isomorphic to the Rado graph [62]
which is universal for any graph, i.e. it allows us to
isomorphically enclose any graph and its supergraphs.
Stability is one of the important properties of Rado
Graph has. There are known studies of universal uncountable structures and corresponding theories including studies of the property of their stability [60]. As for
uncountable structures [31] associated with operational
semantics [16], [55] one direction of research is to study
an approach based on the use of decision procedures
without the presence of enumeration procedures as well
as the use of Büchi automata [61] and their hierarchy.
\par Using the considered classes of structures, one can
represent arbitrary finite graph, pseudograph, multigraph, metagraph, hypergraph structures, including abstract simplicial complexes [28], their combinations and
others.
\par The applied value of the considered classes is the
possibility of algorithmic construction of canonical forms
(representations) of knowledge structures.

The analysis of structural properties implies consideration of topological relations and relations of similarity
(similarity and analogies) and difference. These relations
can be algorithmically realized within the framework of
the knowledge specification model in accordance with the knowledge integration model. The knowledge specification model, by considering finite structures, allows for
the decidability of the corresponding analysis algorithms.
\par As for the similarity relations, they can be formed from
property detection relations or non-detection relations.
A property detection relation itself can be a similarity
relation when the property itself is revealed in its specification (i.e., the relation is reflexive); as a rule, such
relations are transitive. If a property is not revealed in
its specification, but is revealed in other structures, then
all these structures can be united into a class of (pairwise)
similar structures.
In the first case, such relations can be reduced to the
identification of full or partial embeddings, and morphisms: isomorphic, homomorphic or homeomorphic
embedding.

\par The composition of two binary similarity relations is
a binary similarity relation.

\par The union of two \textit{ij}-similarity relations is a \textit{ij}-similarity relation.

\par The intersection of two \textit{ij}-similarity relations is a \textit{ij}-similarity relation.
\par The difference of a \textit{ij}-similarity relation and a \textit{ij}-difference relation is a \textit{ij}-similarity relation.
\par The difference of two \textit{ij}-similarity relations, the first
of which is a subset of the second, is a \textit{ij}-difference
relation.
\par The difference of a \textit{ij}-difference relation and a second
relation is a \textit{ij}-difference relation.
\par The difference of two \textit{ij}-difference relations is a \textit{ij}-difference relation.
\par The union of two \textit{ij}-difference relations is a \textit{ij}-difference relation.
\par The intersection of two \textit{ij}-difference relations is a \textit{ij}-difference relation.
\par In the second case, similarity can be formed as an
equivalence relation or a partial order relation on the set
of structures for which no enumerated embeddings are
identified (in the first case).
\par Topological properties [47] can be investigated
through the consideration of operations on structures that
correspond to topological closure.
\par Among the topological similarities we can distinguish:
similarity on the inclusion of closures, similarity on the
inclusion of derived sets, similarity on the inclusion of
touch points and others.
\par Among topological similarities we can distinguish:
similarity by equivalence of closures, similarity by equivalence of derived sets, similarity by equivalence of touch
points and others.
\par In addition to search operations for extensional closures, we can identify closure operations on the class of
automorphic elements of the structure.
 \par It is also possible to identify search operations by a single (simple) pattern (reverse homomorphism) in extensional closures distancedefined neighborhood of a concept, and

all elements incident to the concept must be all elements of the
automorphism class in this neighborhood. Among such
neighborhoods we can choose a maximal neighborhood.
The corresponding neighborhood can be considered as
a closed set if it is not included in any other such
neighborhood. In this case, the search operation on the
corresponding pattern can also be considered as a closure
operation.
\par The number of mappings of a pseudograph to the
ordinal scale distinguishable with precision up to the
order of vertices does not exceed  $|\textit{V}|^{|\textit{V}|}$. $|\textit{V}|^{|\textit{V}|}$.

The number of mappings of the pseudograph to the metric scale distinguishable with order-ofmagnitude accuracy of pairwise distances does not
exceed ($|\textit{V}^2| - |\textit{V}|)^{(|\textit{V}^ 2| - |\textit{V}|)}$ 
(k-ary generalized distances - ($|\textit{V}^ k| - |\textit{V}|)^{(|\textit{V}^k| - |\textit{V}|)}$).

For finite pseudographs and other representations of
\textit{G} for which the smallest \textit{A} is found:
 \[ G \in A^{(+_7^\ast)} \] 
a quantitative attribute model can be based on the following class of quantitative feature:
 \[ \mathbb{N} \textit{r}_+{^A^{(+_7^\ast)}}\]
where
\[ \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \textit{r} \]

All closures defined on finite structures are finite. Finite structures, including finite (extensional) closures,
have the following (global) characteristics: length, width,
graph dimension, neg-entropy, sets (sets) of local characteristics and others.
Global characteristics can be considered as invariants
[17], [68], on the basis of which characteristics similarity
or proximity measures (metrics or pseudo-metrics) can
be calculated.
Local (conditional) numerical characteristics include:
centrality, metrics [10] and others.
Another example of numerical features are measures
of scalar and coscalar product for introorthogonal sets
considered in taxonomy management problems \textbf{\lbrack} \textbf{\rbrack}.
